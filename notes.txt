set_wallpapers, preload should work
wallpapers.sh has wp urls
right now issue is HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE not set! (is hyprland running?)
  hope fixed on reboot

commented out in hyprland
#exec-once = ~/dotfiles/scripts/preload_wallpapers.sh
#$wp = ~/dotfiles/scripts/set_wallpapers.sh

currently testing the hyprpaper conf works as is, or if need to tweak
